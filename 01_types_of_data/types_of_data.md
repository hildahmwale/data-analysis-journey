Types of Data



In data analytics, data is categorized to help analysts work better and choose the correct tools. So far, I have learned the two main data categories:



1\. Qualitative Data



Descriptive



Non-numerical



Examples: colors, names, feedback, categories



2\. Quantitative Data



Numerical



Can be measured



Examples: prices, age, sales, marks



Quantitative Data Sub-types



Discrete data – whole numbers (e.g., number of students)



Continuous data – measured numbers (e.g., height, weight)



Understanding data types helps analysts choose correct cleaning and analysis methods.
