In spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets, data appears in different formats:



1\. Text (String)



Words, names, labels

Example: “Kenya”, “Product A”



2\. Number



Numerical values

Example: 10, 45.9



3\. Date



Calendar dates

Example: 2025-10-15



4\. Time



Time of day

Example: 14:30 PM



Spreadsheet tools read each type differently, so understanding them prevents errors during analysis.
