Data Analysis Process



I learned that the data analysis process follows a structured cycle. The 6 main steps are:



1\. Ask



Define the problem clearly and ask relevant questions.



2\. Prepare



Collect the right data needed for the solution.



3\. Process (Clean)



Remove errors



Fix missing values



Upload raw data



Make data consistent and complete



4\. Analyze



Use different tools and techniques to find insights, reasons, and patterns.



5\. Share



Communicate results with visuals, presentations, or reports.



6\. Act



Recommend strategies or solutions to decision-makers based on your analysis.



This process ensures that decisions are informed by data
